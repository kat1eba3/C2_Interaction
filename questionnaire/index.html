    <li><b>DESCRIBE YOUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH CODING. WHAT CLASSES HAVE YOU ALREADY TAKEN WHERE YOU WERE EXPOSED TO HTML/CSS/JS? WHAT PARTS OF THE CLASS RESONATED WITH YOU? WHAT PARTS WERE MOST CONFUSING?</b></li>
        <p> I dont have much experience with coding besides from the previous semester's interaction class. The class allowed me to expand my knowledge with coding but more importantly it helped me explore a variety of approaches I could take with code. I think I struggled the most with fully understanding how everything ties together especially when it comes to js.</p>
    <li><b> HOW EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING CODE ARE YOU? ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT LEARNING CODE? IF SO, WHY? WHAT CAN I DO IN THIS CLASS TO HELP REDUCE THIS ANXIETY?</b> </li>
        <p> I'm honestly excited to learn about code as I feel I lack the foundational understanding of the subject. I think last semester I was thrown into this new world of coding without much guidance so I faced many struggles with naviagting how I could translate my ideas onto the screen. For this class I would appreciate being able to build a strong foundation with coding to build my confidence with each future projects. </p>
    <li> <b>HOW DO YOU IMAGINE CODING FITTING IN WITH THE REST OF YOUR DESIGN CURRICULUM AND CAREER AFTER COLLEGE?</b></li> 
        <p> I plan on utilizing code in my future projects as I strongly feel like its a flexible medium that can be applied to my own interests in design. I want to be able to build my own portfolios, websites, and overall be able to use it to elevate my own works in the future.</p>
    <li><b> WHAT TEXT EDITOR DO YOU PREFER TO USE?</b>  </li> 
        <p> I've only used Visual Studio Code so I would say that its what I'm most comfortable with.</p>
    <li> <b>HAVE YOU USED GITHUB BEFORE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? DESCRIBE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF GITHUB.</b></li>
        <p> Yes, I have used Github before although I would say my understanding of it is limited. I'm not too clear about the different types of functions on the site and I've faced problems with publishing my website and having it be an accesible, public link.</p>
    <li> <b>DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. TRY USING A UNIQUE ANALOGY TO DESCRIBE THIS RELATIONSHIP. BONUS POINTS FOR CREATIVE ANALOGIES.</b></li>
        <p> 
            If HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were ingredients in a cooking recipe, HTML would be the base – the flour that provides structure. CSS would be the seasoning and garnishes, enhancing the visual appeal and styling of the dish. JavaScript, on the other hand, would be the special edition flavors, altering flavors, and bringing the special experience to life. </p>

             <p> I really enjoy how this website provides a list of sites where you can scroll through to gather inspiration from other designers. I find myself visiting often whenever I need to explore and imagine new ideas. </p>
        <li> https://www.adultswim.com/etcetera/choir/</li>
        <p> This is a website that I had fun with. I really enjoyed the level of detail in this silly, interactive game such as the movemment of the lips and the changing gradients of the background. </p>
